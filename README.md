# Cadmus Graph Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.7.

This is a demo shell for playing with the Cadmus frontend graph components, not intended for production. The backend used in this demo is at the [Cadmus Graph repository](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-graph).

To use this library in your Cadmus app:

(1) `npm i @swimlane/ngx-graph @myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui-ex`.

(2) in your `package.json`, ensure to override the d3 selection dependency to fix `ngx-graph` issues:

```json
  "overrides": {
    "d3-selection": "3.0.0"
  },
```

(3) in your app routes module, import the library like:

```ts
  // cadmus - graph
  {
    path: 'graph',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-pg-ex').then(
        (module) => module.CadmusGraphPgExModule
      ),
    canActivate: [AuthJwtGuardService],
  },
```
